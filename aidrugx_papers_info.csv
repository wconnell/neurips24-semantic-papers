Xing']","Proteins play a fundamental role in life. Understanding the language of proteins
offers significant potential for gaining mechanistic insights into biological sys-
tems and introduces new avenues for treating diseases, enhancing agriculture, and
safeguarding the environment. While large protein language models (PLMs) like
ESM2-15B and xTrimoPGLM-100B have achieved remarkable performance in di-
verse protein understanding and design tasks, these models, being dense transformer
models, pose challenges due to their computational inefficiency during training
and deployment. In this work, we introduce AIDO.Protein, a pretrained module
for protein representation in an AI-driven Digital Organism [1 ]. AIDO.Protein is
also the first mixture-of-experts (MoE) model in the protein domain, with model
size scales to 16 billion parameters. Leveraging a sparse MoE architecture with
8 experts within each transformer block and selectively activating 2 experts for
each input token, our model is significantly more efficient in training and inference.
Through pre-training on 1.2 trillion amino acids collected from UniRef90 and
ColabfoldDB, our model achieves state-of-the-art results across most tasks in the
xTrimoPGLM benchmark. Furthermore, on over 280 ProteinGym Deep Mutational
Scanning (DMS) assays, our model achieves nearly 99% of the overall performance
of the best MSA-based model and significantly outperforms the previously reported
state-of-the-art models that do not utilize MSA. We also adapted this model for
structure-conditioned protein sequence generation tasks and achieved new SOTA

Li']","Accurate protein identification from mass spectrometry (MS) data is fundamental to unraveling the complex roles of proteins in biological systems, with peptide sequencing being a pivotal step in this process. The two main paradigms for peptide sequencing are database search, which matches experimental spectra with peptide sequences from databases, and \emph{de novo} sequencing, which infers peptide sequences directly from MS without relying on pre-constructed database. Although database search methods are highly accurate, they are limited by their inability to identify novel, modified, or mutated peptides absent from the database. In contrast, \emph{de novo} sequencing is adept at discovering novel peptides but often struggles with missing peaks issue, further leading to lower precision. We introduce SearchNovo, a novel framework that synergistically integrates the strengths of database search and \emph{de novo} sequencing to enhance peptide sequencing. SearchNovo employs an efficient search mechanism to retrieve the most similar peptide spectrum match (PSM) from a database for each query spectrum, followed by a fusion module that utilizes the reference peptide sequence to guide the generation of the target sequence. Furthermore, we observed that dissimilar (noisy) reference peptides negatively affect model performance. To mitigate this, we constructed pseudo reference PSMs to minimize their impact. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple datasets reveal that SearchNovo significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models. Also, analysis indicates that many retrieved spectra contain missing peaks absent in the query spectra, and the retrieved reference peptides often share common fragments with the target peptides. These are key elements in the recipe for SearchNovo’s success. The code for reproducing the results are available in the supplementary materials.",['Peptide Sequencing'],,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=MfphfLFhD4,spotlight

These tasks typically involve black-box discrete sequence optimization, where the challenge lies in generating sequences that are not only biologically feasible but also adhere to hard fine-grained constraints. However, LLMs often struggle with such constraints, especially in biological contexts where verifying candidate solutions is costly and time-consuming. In this study, we explore the possibility of employing LLMs as *highly-constrained bilevel optimizers* through a methodology we refer to as Language Model Optimization with Margin Expectation (LLOME). This approach combines both offline and online optimization, utilizing limited oracle evaluations to iteratively enhance the sequences generated by the LLM. We additionally propose a novel training objective -- Margin-Aligned Expectation (MargE) -- that trains the LLM to smoothly interpolate between the reward and reference distributions.
Lastly, we introduce a synthetic test suite that bears strong geometric similarity to real biophysical problems and enables rapid evaluation of LLM optimizers without time-consuming lab validation. Our findings reveal that, in comparison to genetic algorithm baselines, LLMs achieve significantly lower regret solutions while requiring fewer test function evaluations. However, we also observe that LLMs exhibit moderate miscalibration, are susceptible to generator collapse, and have difficulty finding the optimal solution when no explicit ground truth rewards are available.","['large language models', 'optimizers', 'biophysical sequence optimization']",,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SzfRVq8X07,spotlight

GAO', 'Leo J Lee', 'Brendan Frey']","RNA editing is an important post-transcriptional modification which increases transcriptomic diversity and regulates other cellular processes. In humans, the predominant form of RNA editing is adenosine-to-inosine (A-to-I) conversion, mediated by adenosine deaminases acting on RNA (ADAR) enzymes. Recently, RNA therapeutics leveraging endogenous ADAR to induce site-specific editing have emerged as promising approaches for correcting disease causing mutations and modulating gene expression. However, the precise mechanisms by which cis-regulatory elements control ADAR editing are highly complex and remain largely unknown. With improvements in methods for ADAR editing detection and quantification, a data-driven approach utilizing large-scale RNA-seq data from the existing literature has emerged as a promising strategy for modeling and understanding the general regulatory elements of ADAR editing. Here, we present DeepADAR, a deep learning model that learns regulatory elements of ADAR editing by training on a large number of high-confidence ADAR editing sites supported by RNA-seq data. DeepADAR not only achieves strong performance on predicting editing sites in held-out test data, but also successfully distinguishes sites with varying editing efficiencies in CRISPR mutagenesis experiments and RNA-editing quantitative trait loci (QTLs). Furthermore, we demonstrate how the endogenous regulatory elements of ADAR editing learned by DeepADAR can be utilized to predict ADAR editing induced by guide RNAs (gRNAs) in a zero-shot setting. Notably, DeepADAR can predict both on-target and off-target editing induced by gRNAs, demonstrating its potential utility in RNA therapeutics design","['RNA editing', 'RNA therapeutics', 'drug design', 'deep learning for RNA biology', 'RNA']",,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=D8wVEAKFRA,spotlight

Here we introduce Clone-informed Bayesian Optimization (CloneBO), a Bayesian optimization procedure that efficiently optimizes antibodies in the lab by teaching a generative model how our immune system optimizes antibodies. Our immune system makes antibodies by iteratively evolving specific portions of their sequences to bind their target strongly and stably, resulting in a set of related, evolving sequences known as a clonal family. We train a large language model, CloneLM, on hundreds of thousands of clonal families and use it to design sequences with mutations that are most likely to optimize an antibody within the human immune system. We guide our designs to fit previous measurements using a twisted sequential Monte Carlo procedure. We show that CloneBO optimizes antibodies substantially more efficiently than previous methods in realistic in silico experiments and designs stronger and more stable binders in in vitro wet lab experiments.",['Antibodies + generative models + Bayesian optimization + foundation model'],,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BMiHsF6YOd,spotlight

However, it poses significant challenges for complex diseases with poorly understood mechanisms of action. Addressing these diseases requires the efficient integration of new data while minimizing retraining time, prompting us to develop domain-specific graph augmentation techniques that support semi-inductive reasoning. We discovered that leveraging counterfactual relationships derived from disease-specific topological structures significantly enhances model performance. Based on this insight, we integrated counterfactual relationships as an augmentation method and an initialization step in our knowledge graph (KG) link prediction training process. We introduce KGïA, an inductive KG augmentation method that utilizes counterfactual relationships based on disease-specific topologies. By aligning augmentation with the intrinsic topological features of disease entities, KGïA enhances the KG in a domain-specific manner, facilitating the discovery of a broader range of novel drug candidates tailored to specific diseases. Our biomedical KG comprises 1,614,801 triples and 100,563 biomedical entities, including 30,006 diseases, constructed from 6 biomedical datasets and enriched through Natural Language Processing (NLP) relation extraction. Extensive experiments on this comprehensive KG using 5 augmented architectures demonstrate that semi-inductive reasoning significantly improves generalizability (up to a 24× increase in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)) and that augmented models outperform state-of-the-art KG-based drug repurposing methods (up to a 32\% improvement in MRR). Additionally, in an Alzheimer's Disease (AD) case study, our model identified up to 5 mechanism categories compared to 2 in the baseline, highlighting its enhanced capability to uncover diverse drug candidates.","['drug repurposing', 'graph machine learning', 'knowledge graph', 'graph augmentation', 'inductive reasoning', 'foundation models', ""alzheimer's disease""]",,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=ltMdWRc7A9,spotlight

These models are typically trained on sequence data, structural data, or a combination of both. Sequence-based models learn constraints governing protein structure and function from sequence data and fall broadly into two categories: alignment-based models and protein language models (PLMs). We provide the first detailed comparison of modeling approaches specifically for viruses. We curated a dataset of over 59 standardized viral deep mutational scanning assays and assessed the relative performance of three alignment-based models (PSSM, EVmutation, and EVE), three PLMs (ESM-1v, Tranception, and VESPA), and two versions of SaProt, a structurally-aware protein language model (SaProt-AF2 and SaProt-PDB). Interestingly, deeper alignments often led to worse performance for alignment-based models. On the other hand, PLMs tended to perform better as the size of the training database increased. Overall, alignment-based models outperformed sequence-only PLMs, while the best alignment based model performed on par with SaProt-PDB. Our findings suggest that modeling strategies that are effective for other taxa may not translate directly to viruses, likely due to the limited number of viral sequences used for training.

For example, in the protein inverse folding task, where the goal is to generate a protein sequence from a given backbone structure, conditional diffusion models have achieved impressive results in generating natural-like sequences that fold back into the original structure. However, practical design tasks often require not only modeling a conditional distribution but also optimizing specific task objectives. For instance, in the inverse folding task, we may prefer protein sequences with high stability. To address this, we consider the scenario where we have pre-trained discrete diffusion models that can generate natural-like sequences, as well as reward models that map sequences to task objectives. We then formulate the reward maximization problem within discrete diffusion models, analogous to reinforcement learning (RL), while minimizing the KL divergence against pretrained diffusion models to preserve naturalness. To solve this RL problem, we propose a novel algorithm, DRAKES, that enables direct backpropagation of rewards through entire trajectories generated by diffusion models,
by making the originally non-differentiable trajectories differentiable using the Gumbel-Softmax trick.
Our theoretical analysis indicates that our approach can generate sequences that are both natural-like (i.e., have a high probability under a pretrained model) and yield high rewards.
While similar tasks have been recently explored in diffusion models for continuous domains, our work addresses unique algorithmic and theoretical challenges specific to discrete diffusion models, which arise from their foundation in continuous-time Markov chains rather than Brownian motion.

We develop models with 20M and 90M parameters trained on the MOSES and ZINC datasets, respectively, using the Sequential Attachment-based Fragment Embedding (SAFE) representation. 
We compare MAMBA models against the prevailing Transformer architecture in terms of generation quality and computational efficiency.
Our findings suggest that MAMBA models can achieve performance comparable to Transformers in generating valid, unique, and diverse molecules. Generation from both architectures can achieve close to perfect validity and uniqueness scores, although MAMBA models require more conservative sampling parameters or regeneration steps to achieve these results. MAMBA models consistently demonstrates lower perplexity and reduced GPU power consumption (up to 30\% reduction) compared to Transformer models. 
These results indicate that State Space Models may offer a computationally efficient alternative for molecular generation tasks, potentially enabling more efficient processing of larger datasets and complex molecular structures. 
The efficiency gains of MAMBA models become more pronounced with longer sequences, suggesting that this architecture could enable the modeling and generation of more complex molecules. This capability could significantly expand the scope of AI-driven molecular design in drug discovery.","['state space architecture', 'transformer architecture', 'drug discovery', 'de novo generation']",,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=1ib5oyTQIb,accept

Computational methods hold the potential to accelerate the development of TCRs binding towards target antigens. While the computational investigation of the TCR-epitope landscape has been mainly focused on binding prediction, synthetic TCR design has recently emerged as the next frontier. Here, we present a proof-of-concept study on generating full TCR sequences reactive to a fixed epitope $\textit{in silico}$.

It extracts textual genetic information from NCBI, mutation status from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC) dataset, textual descriptions of drugs from PubChem, and chemical geometry from the PM6 dataset. Then, PanRX utilizes a geometric model to learn chemical conformation, a language model to learn textual description, and a graph neural network to fuse all information and predict the target drug effects. We verify the effectiveness of PanRX by achieving the generalization performance with very low MSE (< 0.0000) and MAE (0.0009). This work emphasizes the potential of merging knowledge graphs and deep learning in the fields of genomics and medicine, enriching the intersection of human biological expertise and AI in drug discovery and design tasks.","['Foundational Model', 'Drug Discovery', 'Computational Biology', 'Personalized Medicine']",,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Y61fBtTfih,accept

The growing availability of large-scale observational healthcare databases, combined with the rise of foundational models, offer an unparalleled opportunity to enable automatic high-throughput drug screening for both repurposing and pharmacovigilance. In this work, we present a general workflow for automatic high-throughput drug screening which estimates the association between various drug exposures and disease outcomes. We provide frameworks for parsing the accurate exposure length for each prescription from clinical texts and removing confounding relationships between drugs and diseases using bioinformatic mapping and foundational models. Using a self-controlled cohort study design, we tested the intention-to-treat association between 3,444 medications and 276 diseases across 6.6 million UK patients from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD).

These models adapt auto-regressive language models to molecular data by considering molecules as sequences of atoms, where each atom is mapped to individual tokens of the language models. However, such atom-level tokenizations limit the models' ability to capture the global structural context of molecules. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel molecular language model, coined Context-Aware Molecular T5 (CAMT5). Inspired by the importance of the substructure-level contexts, e.g., ring systems, in understanding molecules, we introduce substructure-level tokenization for molecular language models. Specifically, we construct a tree structure for each molecule whose nodes correspond to important substructures, i.e., motifs. Then, we train our CAMT5 by considering a molecule as a sequence of motif tokens, whose order is determined by a tree-search algorithm. Under the proposed motif token space, one can incorporate chemical context with a significantly shorter token length (than atom-level tokenizations), which is useful for mitigating the issues during the auto-regressive molecular generation, e.g., error propagation. In addition, CAMT5 guarantees to generate a valid molecule with non-degeneracy, i.e., no ambiguity in the meaning of each token, which is 
also overlooked in previous models. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CAMT5 in the text-to-molecule generation task. Finally, we also propose a simple strategy of ensemble that can aggregate the outputs of molecular language models of different tokenizations, e.g., SMILES, SELFIES and ours, further boosting the quality of the generated molecules.","['drug discovery', 'text-to-molecule generation', 'molecular language models']",,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BDISzo0dZi,accept

However, these trials are often lengthy, labor-intensive, and expensive. The duration of a clinical trial significantly impacts overall costs, making efficient timeline management crucial for controlling budgets and ensuring the economic feasibility of research.
To address this issue, We propose TrialDura, a multimodal and interpretable deep learning method that estimates the duration of clinical trials using multimodal data, including disease names, drug molecules, trial phases, and eligibility criteria. Then, we encode them into Bio-BERT embeddings specifically tuned for biomedical contexts to provide a deeper and more relevant semantic understanding of clinical trial data. Finally, the model’s hierarchical attention mechanism connects all of the embeddings to capture their interactions and predict clinical trial duration.

Traditional physics-based simulation methods often struggle with sampling equilibrium conformations and are computationally expensive. Recently, deep generative models have shown promise in generating protein conformations as a more efficient alternative. However, these methods predominantly rely on the diffusion process within a 3D geometric space, which typically centers around the vicinity of metastable states and is often inefficient in terms of runtime. In this paper, we introduce Structure Language Modeling (SLM) as a novel framework for efficient protein conformation generation. Specifically, the protein structures are first encoded into a compact latent space using a discrete variational auto-encoder, followed by conditional language modeling that effectively captures sequence-specific conformation distributions.  This enables a more efficient and interpretable exploration of diverse ensemble modes compared to existing methods. Based on this general framework, we instantiate SLM with various popular LM architectures as well as proposing the ESMDiff, a novel BERT-like structure language model fine-tuned from ESM3 with masked diffusion. We verify our approach in various scenarios, including the equilibrium dynamics of BPTI, conformational change pairs, and intrinsically disordered proteins.

In contrast to prior methods regularizing all individuals' transport ""costs"" and then applying them to the population  *homogeneously*, CLSB directly regularizes *population* cost allowing for population *heterogeneity* and potentially improving model *generalizability*.

Pinheiro', 'Richard Bonneau', 'Saeed Saremi', 'Vishnu Sresht']","Ligand-based drug discovery (LBDD) relies on making use of known binders to a protein target to find structurally diverse molecules similarly likely to bind. This process typically involves a brute force search of the known binder (query) against a molecular library using some metric of molecular similarity. One popular approach overlays the pharmacophore-shape profile of the known binder to 3D conformations enumerated for each of the library molecules, computes overlaps, and picks a set of diverse library molecules with high overlaps. While this virtual screening workflow has had considerable success in hit diversification, scaffold hopping, and patent busting, it scales poorly with library sizes and restricts candidate generation to existing library compounds. Leveraging recent advances in voxel-based generative modelling, we propose a pharmacophore-based generative model and workflows that address the scaling and fecundity issues of conventional pharmacophore-based virtual screening. We introduce VoxCap, a voxel captioning method for generating SMILES strings from voxelised molecular representations. We propose two workflows as practical use cases as well as benchmarks for pharmacophore-based generation: de-novo design, in which we aim to generate new molecules with high pharmacophore-shape similarities to query molecules, and fast search, which aims to combine generative design with a cheap 2D substructure similarity search for efficient hit identification. Our results show that VoxCap significantly outperforms previous methods in generating diverse de-novo hits.

It enables the prediction of ligand-protein interactions by simulating the binding of small molecules to proteins. Despite the availability of numerous docking algorithms, there is no single algorithm consistently outperforms the others across a diverse set of docking scenarios. This paper introduces GNNAS-Dock, a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based automated algorithm selection system for molecular docking in blind docking situations. GNNs are accommodated to process the complex structural data of both ligands and proteins. They benefit from the inherent graph-like properties to predict the performance of various docking algorithms under different conditions. The present study pursues two main objectives: 1) predict the performance of each candidate docking algorithm, in terms of Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD), thereby identifying the most accurate method for specific scenarios; and 2) choose the best computationally efficient docking algorithm for each docking case, aiming to reduce the time required for docking while maintaining high accuracy. We validate our approach on PDBBind 2020 refined set, which contains about 5,300 pairs of protein-ligand complexes. Our strategy is performed across a portfolio of 6 different state-of-the-art docking algorithms. To be specific, the candidate algorithms are DiffDock, DSDP, TankBind, GNINA, SMINA, Qvina-W. We additionally combine p2rank with GNINA, SMINA and Qvina-W for docking site prediction. Therefore, there are totally 9 different algorithms for selection. Our algorithm selection model achieves a mean RMSD of approximately 1.74 Å, significantly improving upon the top performing docking algorithm (DiffDock), which has a mean RMSD of 2.95 Å. Moreover, when making selection in consideration of computational efficiency, our model demonstrates a success rate of 79.73% in achieving an RMSD below the 2 Å threshold, with a mean RMSD value of 2.75 Å and an average processing time of about 29.05 seconds per instance. In contrast, the remaining docking algorithms like TankBind, though faster with a processing time of merely 0.03 seconds per instance, only achieve an RMSD below the 2 Å threshold in less than 60% of cases. These findings demonstrate the capability of GNN-based algorithm selection to significantly enhance docking performance while effectively reducing the computational time required, balancing efficiency with precision in molecular docking.","['molecular docking', 'automated algorithm selection', 'graph neural networks']",,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=W4d1a4odSc,accept

Experimental determination of gene essentiality requires large growth screens that are time-consuming and expensive, motivating the development of in silico approaches. Existing methods predominantly utilise flux balance analysis (FBA), a constraint-based optimisation algorithm; however, they are fundamentally limited by the necessity of a predefined cellular objective function. This requirement introduces an element of observer bias, as the objective function often reflects the researcher’s assumptions rather than the cell’s biological goals. Here, we present FluxGAT, a graph neural network (GNN) model capable of predicting gene essentiality directly from graphical representations of flux sampling data. Flux sampling removes the need for objective functions, thereby eliminating observer bias. FluxGAT leverages the unique strengths of GNNs in learning representations of complex relationships within metabolic reaction networks. The success of our approach in predicting experimentally determined gene essentiality, with almost double the sensitivity of FBA, explores the possibility of predicting cellular phenotypes in cases when objectives are less understood.

To address this challenge, we propose Multi-Fidelity Latent space Active Learning (MF-LAL), a generative modeling framework that integrates a set of oracles with varying cost-accuracy tradeoffs. Unlike previous approaches that separately learn the surrogate model and generative model, MF-LAL combines the generative and multi-fidelity surrogate models into a single framework, allowing for more accurate activity prediction and higher quality samples. We train MF-LAL with a novel active learning algorithm to further reduce computational cost.

As a result, computational methods, including diffusion models, designed for molecule generation tasks have gained significant traction. Despite their potential, they have faced criticism for producing physically implausible outputs. We alleviate this problem by conditionally training a diffusion model capable of generating molecules of varying and controllable levels of structural plausibility. This is achieved by adding distorted molecules to training datasets, and then annotating each molecule with a label representing the extent of its distortion, and hence its quality. By training the model to distinguish between favourable and unfavourable molecular conformations alongside the standard molecule generation training process, we can selectively sample molecules from the high-quality region of learned space, resulting in improvements in the validity of generated molecules. In addition to the standard two datasets used by molecule generation methods (QM9 and GEOM), we also test our method on a druglike dataset derived from ZINC.

Protein language models like ESM-2, though effective for natural peptides, cannot however encode chemical modifications. Conversely, pre-trained chemical language models excel in representing small molecule properties but are not optimized for peptides.

To address these limitations, we propose an alternative approach to derive phenotypes, which we term embedding-derived phenotypes (EDPs). Our approach consists of two steps. First, we train a self-supervised representation learning model to transform scans into latent embeddings, eliminating the need for manual annotations. Second, we convert these embeddings into disease-relevant phenotypes, preserving the information that may be lost in manually derived phenotypes. Although there are numerous self-supervised representation learning methods, it is not straightforward to transform the embeddings from these models into disease-relevant phenotypes. We present two simple methods that leverage binary labels like ICD-10 codes and demonstrate that the proposed methods identify more biologically meaningful genetic associations compared to using ICD-10 codes alone as binary traits or manually derived phenotypes.","['representation learning', 'GWAS', 'masked autoencoders', 'UKBB MRI', 'video MAE', 'phenotypes']",,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=cuD5ZfMwMk,accept

Biological knowledge graphs can bootstrap the inference of causal structures in these situations, but since they compile vastly diverse information, they can bias predictions towards well-studied systems.
Alternatively, amortized causal structure learning algorithms encode inductive biases through data simulation and train supervised models to recapitulate these synthetic graphs.
However, realistically simulating biology is arguably even harder than understanding a specific system.
In this work, we take inspiration from both strategies and propose an amortized algorithm for refining domain knowledge, based on data observations.

Here, we introduce KGWAS, a novel geometric deep learning method that leverages a knowledge graph to integrate massive functional information about variants, genes, gene programs, and their interactions, assessing variant-disease associations. Unlike conventional GWAS, which treats variants independently, our approach recognizes that variants influence disease through complex cellular networks. Our realistic simulations show that KGWAS is well-calibrated and powerful in identifying disease variants. We applied KGWAS to 21 independent UK Biobank diseases/traits from small subsampled cohorts (N=1-10K), and KGWAS produced significantly more independent associations that were replicable in the full cohort (average N=374K), 22.0%-89.9% higher than state-of-the-art baselines.

To amortize the cost, we propose a data-driven approach to warm-up the simulation by learning nonlinear interpolations from local dynamics. Specifically, we infer a potential energy function from local dynamics data. To find plausible paths between two metastable states, we formulate a generalized flow matching framework that learns a vector field to sample propable paths between the two marginal densities under the learned energy function.

Recently there has been a surge of new deep learning (DL) models for DRP that improve on the performance of their predecessors. However, different models use different input data types and neural network architectures making it hard to find the source of these improvements. Here we consider multiple published DRP models that report state-of-the-art performance in predicting continuous drug response values. These models take the chemical structures of drugs and omics profiles of cell lines as input. By experimenting with these models and comparing with our own simple benchmarks we show that no performance comes from drug features, instead, performance is due to the transcriptomics cell line profiles. Furthermore, we show that, depending on the testing type, much of the current reported performance is a property of the training target values. To address these limitations we create novel models (BinaryET and BinaryCB) that predict binary drug response values, guided by the hypothesis that this reduces the noise in the drug efficacy data. Thus, better aligning them with biochemistry that can be learnt from the input data.
BinaryCB leverages a chemical foundation model, while  BinaryET is trained from scratch using a transformer-type model. We show that these models learn useful chemical drug features, which is the first time this has been demonstrated for multiple DRP testing types to our knowledge. 
We further show binarising the drug response values is what causes the models to learn useful chemical drug features.

Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method guides the model to sample CDRs with lower energy, enhancing both the structure and sequence of the generated antibodies.","['diffusion models', 'antibody design']",,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=ya5alTUbAW,accept
https://openreview.net/forum?id=lrqHtZvSZW,DiffER: Categorical Diffusion Models for Chemical Retrosynthesis,"['Sean Current', 'Ziqi Chen', 'Xia Ning', 'srinivasan parthasarathy']","Methods for automatic chemical retrosynthesis have found recent success through the application of models traditionally built for natural language processing, primarily through transformer neural networks. These models have demonstrated significant ability to translate between the SMILES encodings of chemical products and reactants, but are constrained as a result of their autoregressive nature. We propose DiffER, an alternative template-free method for retrosynthesis prediction in the form of categorical diffusion, which allows the entire output SMILES sequence to be predicted in unison. We construct an ensemble of diffusion models which achieves state of the art performance for top-1 accuracy and competitive performance for top-3 and top-5 accuracy. We prove that \ours is a strong baseline for a new class of template-free model and is capable of learning a variety of synthetic techniques used in laboratory settings.","['retrosynthesis', 'chemistry', 'diffusion', 'categorical diffusion', 'ensemble']",,https://openreview.net/pdf?id=lrqHtZvSZW,accept
